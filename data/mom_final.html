<h1>📋 Meeting Minutes</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: inherit;">SUMMARY:
The meeting was primarily focused on the development of a product that can automatically generate minutes of meetings (MOM) and create tickets in Jira. Speaker 2, a senior data analyst, proposed using Python, AI models, and Lumetix to generate the MOMs, and OpenAI's large language models (LLM) for automation tasks. The product will require a subscription to OpenAI and Lumetix, costing around $15-20. The data will be stored for approximately 30 days before being cleaned. The project is expected to be completed in a month, with the creation of Jira tickets being addressed in the second phase. Speaker 1 will confirm the project's commencement after receiving approval from management.

ACTION ITEMS:
- [Speaker 2] Complete the development of the product that generates minutes of meeting within one month.
- [Speaker 2] Research on how Jira tickets will be created from the minutes of meeting and provide feedback in the next week.

DECISIONS:
- Agreed to develop a product that can create minutes of meeting (MOM) and automatically generate Jira tickets.
- Decided to use large language models (LLM) and OpenAI for the automation process.
- Agreed to purchase an OpenAI subscription for using these models.
- Decided to store the generated MOMs in a database for a period of 30 days before cleaning.
- Agreed on a project timeline of one month to complete the first phase of generating the MOMs.
- Decided to divide the project into two phases, with the second phase focusing on the automation of Jira ticket creation.
- Agreed to start the development of the product as soon as final confirmation is received from management.

QUESTIONS / ISSUES:
- [Speaker 1] So, can you just let me know more about your expertise and about your technical background, what you have done so far in these years, and how are you going to help us in this particular product?
- [Speaker 1] Can you just tell me about the products, those products, which can help me directly if we don't hire any person, or like, those tools you can let me know about these tools which can help you and me in developing this product?
- [Speaker 2] Actually, can you just explain a little bit more about the LLM models? Because I don't have any understanding of that particular thing, how that's going to work, or how it is useful to our product.
- [Speaker 2] So, like, do we need to purchase any membership for the plants for these kinds of accounts, or?
- [Speaker 2] Can you just tell me about this thing, like how much these tools are constantly so that I have that particular knowledge and can manage my resources and plan everything about it?
- [Speaker 1] Can you just let me go through about this, the architecture, how you're gonna do this and what else requirement you need from our site to make this possible? Like, how you're gonna put this, what will be the structure of this architecture? Like, what will be the main architecture of this particular product? And where are these things going to be stored and where we can extract the details later on if we decline?
- [Speaker 1] So like this will be stored for an LOS number of periods, right? Or like there is any limitation like after a certain period of time we need to remove all the data?
- [Speaker 2] So, like, what will the deadline be like? By how many days would it take to complete this product?
- [Speaker 1] And we are meeting in this one month regarding the automation of the ticket creations and the Jira. All like we are going to take it on the next stage.
- [Speaker 2] So, like, do we have any idea about that particular thing? How the Jira tickets will be created, or probably just a thing?</pre>
